Example Vyper contracts for arbitraging the ever complicared curve tricryptometapool pools! I don't intend to maintain or run any bots since there are experts out there. But if you are into arbitrage bots, here's something for curve-related pools!

Curve tricryptometapools on Polygon (for e.g.) combine a crypto asset with two curve pools (am3pool and tricrypto pool) as well as Aave lending markets.

... more docs to follow (should I find some time to do this). BTW, nothing actually works since I didn't run any tests or anything at all.
